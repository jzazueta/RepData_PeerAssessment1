# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data


Unzip "activity.zip" file--assumed to be on the working directory
read file, gather complete cases and convert dates from strings into 
date objects:

```{r}
 file <- unzip("activity.zip")
        steps <- read.csv(file)
        steps <- steps[complete.cases(steps),]
        steps$date<-as.Date(steps$date)
```
 
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
#generate histogram of steps and calculate mean Iand median steps per day

```{r}
        daily.steps <-aggregate(steps~date,steps,mean)[,2]
        hist(daily.steps, main = "Average Steps per Day", xlab = "Average Steps", col="darkorange")
        mean(daily.steps)
        median(daily.steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
