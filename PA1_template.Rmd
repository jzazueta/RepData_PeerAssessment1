# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

### unzip "activity.zip" file--assumed to be on the working directory
### read file, gather complete cases and convert dates from strings into 
### date objects:

      ```  file <- unzip("activity.zip")
        steps <- read.csv(file)
        steps <- steps[complete.cases(steps),]
        steps$date<-as.Date(steps$date)
      ```

#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
#generate histogram of steps and calculate meanand median steps per day
    ```
        hist(steps$steps, main = "Total Steps per Day", xlab = "Steps")
        mean(steps$steps)
        median(steps$steps)
    ```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
